* Databases, collections, documents are important parts
of MongoDB without them you are not able to store
data on the MongoDB server.

* A Database contains a collection, and a collection
contains documents and the documents contain data,
they are related to each other.

+ In MongoDB, a database contains the collections of
documents.
One can create multiple databases on the MongoDB server.

View Database:
* To see how many databases are present in your MongoDB
server, write the following statement in the mongo shell:

show dbs


----- Page 5 -----
Naming Restriction for Database:

Before creating a database you should first learn about the naming
restrictions for databases:
* In MongoDB, the names of the database are case insensitive, but
you must always remember that the database names cannot differ
only by the case of the characters.
For windows user, MongoDB database names cannot contain any
of these following characters:
A."$*:)2
* For Unix and Linux users, MongoDB database names cannot
contain any of these following characters:
A."$
MongoDB database names cannot contain null characters(in
windows, Unix, and Linux systems).
MongoDB database names cannot be empty and must contain less
than 64 characters.



----- Page 6 -----
Creating Database:

+ Inthe mongo shell, you can create a database with the help of
the following command:
use database_name
This command actually switches you to the new database if the
given name does not exist
If the given name exists, then it will switch you to the existing
database.
Now at this stage, if you use the show command to see the
database list where you will find that your new database is not
present in that database list because, in MongoDB, the
database is actually created when you start entering data in that
database.

Collection

Collections are just like tables in relational databases,
they also store data, but in the form of documents. A
single database is allowed to store multiple

collections.

Schemaless:

As we know that MongoDB databases are schemaless.
So, it is not necessary in a collection that the schema of
one document is similar to another document.

in other words, a single collection contains different
types of documents like as shown in the below example
mystudentData collection contain two different types of
documents:


----- Page 9 -----
@e0@e@ © anki — mongo — 89x17

"amount

{
"id" : "geeks_for_geeks_201",
“name "Rohit",
"branch "ECE",
“course "Sudo Gate",
“year" : 2020
Fe

Collection

Naming Restrictions for Collection:

* Before creating a collection you should first learn about the naming
restrictions for collections:

Collection name must starts with an underscore or a character.

Collection name does not contain $, empty string, null character

and does not begin with system. prefix.

* The maximum length of the collection name is 120 bytes(including
the database name, dot separator, and the collection name).

Creating collection:

+ After creating database now we create a collection to store
documents. The collection is created using the following syntax:
db.collection_name.insertOne({..})

* Here, insertOne() function is used to store single data in the
specified collection.

+ And in the curly braces {} we store our data or in other words, it is
a document

> db.Author.insertOne({name: "Ankita"})
{
"acknowledged" : true,
"insertedId" : ObjectId("5e3799ff1993ad62dcde4f0d")

}
>i


----- Page 12 -----
In this example, we create a collection named as the Author and we

insert data in it with the help of insertOne() function.

{name: “Ankita’”} is a document in the Author collection

the name is the key or field and “Ankita” is the value of this key or
ield.

After pressing enter we got a message(as shown in the image) and

this message tells us that the data enters successfully (i-e.,

“acknowledge”: true)

And also assigns an automatically created id.

It is the special feature provided by MongoDB that every document

provided a unique id and generally, this id is created automatically,
ut you are allowed to create your own id (must be unique).



----- Page 13 -----
Document

In MongoDB, the data records are stored as BSON
documents.

Here, BSON stands for binary representation of JSON
documents, although BSON contains more data types as
compared to JSON. The document is created using
field-value pairs or key-value pairs and the value of the field
can be of any BSON type.

Syntax:

{ field1: value

field2: value2

fieldN: valueN }


----- Page 14 -----
Naming restriction of fields:

* The field names are of strings.

* The _id field name is reserved to use as a
primary key. And the value of this field must
be unique, immutable, and can be of any type
other than an array.

* The field name cannot contain null characters.

* The top-level field names should not start with
a dollar sign ($).

Enable MongoDB's free cloud-based monitoring service, which will then receive and display
metrics about your deployment (disk utilization, CPU, operation statistics, etc).

The monitoring data will be available on a MongoDB website with a unique URL accessible t
© you

and anyone you share the URL with. MongoDB may use this information to make product
improvements and to suggest MongoDB products and deployment options to you.

To enable free monitoring, run the following command: db.enableFreeMonitoring()

Introduction to Relational Data Model



----- Page 2 -----
First introduced by Ted Codd (in 1970).

Uses concept of mathematical relation.

First commercial implementations of the relational model >
Oracle DBMS, SQL/DS system (IBM).

Current popular RDBMSs — SQL Server & Access (Microsoft),
DB2 & Informix (IBM), etc.

Standard for commercial RDBMS — SQL query lang#age.

Terminologies

Relational model represents data as a collection of tables.

A table is also called a relation.

Each row — tuple.

* Ordering of Values within a Tuple:

e Ann-tuple — ordered list of n

values, so ordering of values in

With an alternative definition of
relation, ordering of values in a tuple

is unnecessary.

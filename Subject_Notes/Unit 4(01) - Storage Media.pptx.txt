Physical Storage Media

Physical Storage Media is used for storing (writing
/recording/saving) and retrieving (reading /opening)
data.

A storage medium (media is the plural) is the
physical material on which data is stored.

A storage device is the computer hardware that
records and retrieves data to and from a storage
medium.



----- Page 2 -----
Classification
* Classification of Physical Storage Media is based upon
the following characteristics:
> Speed of access
> Cost per unit of data
> Reliability
+ Data loss on power failure or system crash

* Physical failure of the storage device


----- Page 3 -----
Contd..

* Can differentiate storage into:
* Volatile Storage:

+ Loses contents when power is switched off
* Non-volatile Storage:

+ Contents persist even when power is switched

off.

Types of Storage Media

Cache

Main Memory
Flash Memory
Magnetic Disk
Optical Disk

Magnetic Tapes


----- Page 5 -----
Cache

Most costly and fastest form of storage.
Fast access , volatile.
Very small in size.

High speed memory


----- Page 6 -----
Contd..



----- Page 7 -----
Main Memory

Fast access (10s to 100s of nanoseconds)

Too small or too expensive to store the entire
database.

Volatile memory - Contents of main memory are
usually lost in a power failure or ‘crash’ .

Computer can Manipulate only data that is in main
memory.

Therefore, every program you execute and every file
you access must be copied from a storage device
into main memory

Ex: RAM


----- Page 8 -----
Flash Memory

Non-volatile - Data survives power failure

Reads are roughly as fast as main memory.

But writes are slow (few microseconds), erase is
slower

Widely used in embedded devices such as digital
cameras, USB flash drives, video games, etc..



----- Page 9 -----
Magnetic Disk Storage

Data is stored on spinning disk, and read/written
magnetically

Primary medium for long-term storage.
Typically the entire database can be stored on disk.

Data must be moved from disk to main memory for access,
and written back for storage.

Disk storage is called direct access storage as it is possible
to read data on the disk in any order.

Disk storage usually survives power failures and system
crashes (non-volatile).

Ex: floppy disks, hard disks, etc..


----- Page 10 -----
Optical Storage

Non-volatile, data is read optically from a spinning disk
using a laser

CD-ROM (640 MB) and DVD (4.7 to 17 GB) most popular
forms

Blu-ray discs: 27 GB to 54 GB

Write-one, read-many (WORM) optical discs used for
archival storage (CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R)

Multiple write versions also available (CD-RW, DVD-RW,
DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM)

Reads and writes are slower than with magnetic disk



----- Page 11 -----
Tape Storage
Non-volatile, used primarily for backup (to recover
from disk failure), and for archival data
Sequential-access - much slower than disk
Very high capacity (40 to 300 GB tapes available)

Tape can be removed from drive > storage costs much
cheaper than disk, but drives are expensive

Tape jukeboxes available for storing massive amounts
of data

— hundreds of terabytes (1 terabyte = 10° bytes) to even
multiple petabytes (1 petabyte = 10'? bytes)

* Primary storage: fastest media but volatile
(cache, main memory).

* Secondary storage: next level in hierarchy, non-
volatile, moderately fast access time

—E.G. Flash memory, magnetic disks
* Tertiary storage: lowest level in hierarchy, non-
volatile, slow access time
— Also called off-line storage
—E.G. Magnetic tape, optical storage

Magnetic Disks

* Magnetic disks provide the bulk of secondary storage for
modern computer systems.

+ The storage requirements of large applications have
been growing very faster than the growth rate of disk

capacities.

Platter:

* Each disk platter has a flat, circular shape.

* Its two surfaces are covered with a magnetic
material, and information is recorded on the
surfaces.

Read-write head:

* Positioned very close to the platter surface (almost
touching it)

* Reads or writes magnetically encoded information.


----- Page 20 -----
What are tracks and sectors?



----- Page 21 -----
Tracks:

+ Surface of platter divided into
circular tracks

+ Over 50K-100K tracks per
platter on typical hard disks

Sectors:

+ Each track is divided into
sectors.

+ A sector is the smallest unit of

| amasenbly

data that can be read or written.
+ Sector size - typically 512 bytes
+ Typical sectors per track: 500 to
1000 (on inner tracks) to 1000 to
2000 (on outer tracks)



----- Page 22 -----
To read/write a

ctor:

Disk arm swings to position head on
right track

Platter spins continually; data is
read/written as sector passes under

head

Head-disk assemblies:

Multiple disk platters on a single
spindle (1 to 5 usually)

One head per platter, mounted on a
common arm

Cylinder i consists of i‘ track of all

the platters

Disk Controller:

* Interfaces between the computer system _and_the
actual hardware of the disk drive.

* It accepts commands to r/w_a sector, and initiate
actions.

+ Disk controllers also attach checksums to each sector
to check read error.

+ Remapping of bad sectors: If a controller detects that
a sector is damaged when the disk is initially
formatted, or when an attempt is made to write the
sector, it can logically map the sector to a different
physical location.

Performance Measures of Disks

Access time

Seek time

Rotational latency

Data-transfer rate

Mean time to failure (MTTF)

Time from when a r/w request is issued and when
data transfer begins

Time for repositioning the arm

The time spent waiting for the sector to be accesses
to appear under the head

The rate at which data can be retrieved from or
stored to the disk

ranges from 30,000
to 800,000 hours (about 3.4 to 91 years).

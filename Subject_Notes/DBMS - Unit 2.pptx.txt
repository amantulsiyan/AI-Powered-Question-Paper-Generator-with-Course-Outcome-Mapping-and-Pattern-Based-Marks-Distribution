c. What constraints do the partial key and the identifying relationship of the

Sol: The constraint of the partial key
BranchNo is that we need to combine
BranchNo with Code (owner entity type key),
to uniquely identify Bank-Branch.

Constraint of the identifying relationship:

(i) The weak entity set must have total participation in the identifying relationship

set, Branches.

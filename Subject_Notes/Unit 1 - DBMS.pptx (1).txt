Functionalities:
Define: Specifying the data type, structures and constraints
for the data to be stored.

Construct: Process of storing data on some storage medium.

Manipulate: Querying the database to retrieve specific data,
updating database and generating reports.

Share: Allows multiple users and programs to access the

database concurrently.

1. A database represents some aspects of the real world (miniworld).
2. A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some
inherent meaning.

3. A database is designed, built and populated with data for a

specific purpose.

Self-Describing Nature of a Database System

Database system — Database + Meta got (DB Definition)

Stored in: DBMS catalog

Used by: DBMS Software & Database Users

DBMS software must work equally well with any number of
database applications.

In traditional file processing, data definition — part of

application programs — work with only one specific DB.


----- Page 15 -----
* In traditional file processing — structure of data files is

embedded in the application programs.

* In database approach — structure of data files is stored in the

DBMS catalog — separate from access programs

(program-data independence).

----- Page 17 -----
The characteristic that allows program-data independence is

called data abstraction.
DBMS provides users with conceptual representation of data.
Data model — type of data abstraction — provides

conceptual representation.



----- Page 18 -----
]
* A database has many users, each of whom may require a
different view of database.

* A view — subset of database — contains virtual data derived

from database (not explicitly stored).



----- Page 19 -----
Sharing of Data and Multiuser Transaction
Processing

A multiuser DBMS allows multiple users to access the database
at the same time.

DBMS must include concurrency control.

OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) — major part of
database application.

DBMS must enforce several transaction properties:

i. Isolation ii. Atomicit

Introduction to Data Models



----- Page 21 -----
Data Models

vx Underlying structure of a database.
% Conceptual tool.

% Data + Relationship + Semantics + Constraints.

% Design the database at physical, logical and view level.


----- Page 22 -----
Relational Model.

. Entity-Relationship Model.
. Object-based Data Model.
. Semistructured Data Model.



----- Page 23 -----
1. Relational Model

Collection of tables.

Tables represent both data and relationships.

Multiple columns with unique names.

Tables = Relations.

Record-based model.

Fixed-format records of several types.

Each record type defines a fixed number of fields, or attributes.

Most widely used data model.

Current DBS are based on relational model.

E-R data model or E-R model.
Collection of basic objects called entities and its relationship.

An entity is a real world thing or object.

Distinguishable from other objects.

Widely used in database design.



----- Page 26 -----
2. Entity-Relationship Model



----- Page 27 -----
3. Object-Based Model

OOP Languages - C++, Java, C# etc.,

Need for Object-oriented data model.

Object-Based Model = E-R Model + OO features.
Object-Relational Data Model = Object-Based Model + Relational

attributes.

Query processing

Otherwise, a dialogue is started with the user for further
clarification.

DBMS Interfaces

* Interfaces for Parametric Users:
e Parametric users — have small set of operations that they

must perform repeatedly.

System analysts and programmers — design & implement a

special interface for these users.

* Interfaces for the DBA:

e Privileged commands (like for creating accounts, granting

access) that can be used only by the DBA’s staff.
